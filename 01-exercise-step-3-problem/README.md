The business domain events with which we came up are now sequenced into 
a business narrative:

* Vehicle Added
* Vehicle Available
* Ride Requested
* Ride Scheduled
* Ride Cancelled
* Rider Picked Up
* Rider Dropped Off
* Vehicle Return Requested
* Vehicle Returned
* Vehicle Removed

The goal of this step is to add key moments in the user experience to
the timeline of events.  If the sequence of events is like the script
of a film, then this step is like creating the storyboard: adding
visuals to the key plot points.

[Interfaces](./interfaces) are represented by white printer paper with mockups drawn
on them. As with any good storyboard, we'll need to identify the
various characters involved in the plot.  This is done by separating
our Interfaces into horizontal lanes representing the various
Audiences (aka personas or roles) that use our system.
