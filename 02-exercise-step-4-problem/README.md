# Exercise 2, Step 4

### [link to module (business value streams and bounded contexts)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/vX08Qt5xHsY?si=ibBy5SDK2B9RNAak?&start=13&end=144)

<br>

The data flow of the state change and state view slices are exposed 
on the event model:

[evidentdesign.com import](event-model.json)

instructor's solution
![instructor's solution](event-model.png "instructor's solution")

student's solution
<br>
![student's solution](event-model.jpg "student's solution")

Note that the stream of events can be partitioned into separate 
business domains, e.g., (1) vehicle availability or (2) the lifecycle 
of rides.

Use horizontal swim lanes to show the partitions of the business 
value streams.
