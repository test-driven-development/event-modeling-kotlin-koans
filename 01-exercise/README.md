# Overview

In this exercise, we'll build our event model out to the point of
functioning like a storyboard for a film.  This phase of the
event modeling workshop proceeds in 3 steps:

(1) First, we'll begin with a blank event model, and proceed 
    by brainstorming our business domain events.  We won't worry about
    properly ordering/sequencing them.  When we're done, the model 
    should look something like this ([png](event-model-01.png) |
    [json export](event-model-01.json)).

(2) Next, we'll sequence the events into a plausible business 
    narrative, sort of like the script of a film. When we're done, 
    the model should look something like this ([png](event-model-02.png) | 
    [json export](event-model-02.json)).

(3) Finally, we'll add [interfaces](interfaces) above our events to 
    visualize the user experience at that point in the workflow, similar 
    to how a film's storyboard combines visuals with key plot points. 
    When we're done, the model should look something like this
    ([png](event-model-03.png) | [json export](event-model-03.json)).

## Completing this Exercise with [Evident Design](https://evidentstack.com/)

Create a new Event Model in Evident Design for each step, and follow
the instructions in that step by adding elements to the modeling
canvas.  

(Caveat: the Evident Design UI is still in beta, so if you experience friction, 
you can [import](https://docs.onote.com/onote-docs/Latest/models/import-export-models.html)
the `event-model.json` of the previous step with the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+I`.)

## Completing this Exercise with sticky notes or a drawing app

Add events to the modeling canvas and reconcile it with the event 
timeline provided in `event-model.png`.
