The goal of this step is to brainstorm the domain events within our
[business process](../README.md#use-case). 

Events are represented as orange sticky notes that are placed below 
the Timeline lane, and are named as verb phrases in the past tense, 
e.g., "Ride Requested" or "Vehicle Added."

Add as many events to your modeling canvas as necessary to describe
both the vehicle owner/inventory management and the ride-lifecycle
business processes.  Don't worry about ordering these events or making
mistakes: go broad first, then we'll narrow down and sequence in the
next few steps.
